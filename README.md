Video Game Design Sanctuary
  
  This is a company I am starting here on GitHub, that I hope to one day grow and bring back the awesomeness of old school Final Fantasy-styled games using mainly C++/Blueprints and Unreal, Blender, Inkscape, Gimp, and Audacity.  
  
  If you want to be a part of this company and work together on making some games, please reach out to my email. I would love to hear from you.  MY name is Justin, and my friends call me Cid.  
  
  My licensing on here will be not open-source, at least for a while. I have a year left in my university so I am still on the learning curve, but I am 37 so I am mature enough to start something serious like this and care for it as it grows into something beautiful. 
  
  I cannot pay, and it is not a job.  If you want to work with me, we must become friends and enjoy the projects we work on together, period.  Let's make some magic, do not be shy, I am awesome and so are you, so hit me up!
